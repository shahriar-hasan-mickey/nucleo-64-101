# Till then look around my other projects. [e.g. <u>[A simple C Compiler</u>](https://github.com/shahriar-hasan-mickey/A-simple-C-Compiler)</u>]. 
It is A front end of a compiler that compiles simple C code. | Tools & technologies used: C/C++, Bison & Flex <br/>
  * The compiler parses simple C code and generates token of each literals, storing information in the symbol table to be

code itself
